# Extremely Powerful Capybaras Developer Console
ImGui developer console created for [Extremely Powerful Capybaras](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2089980/Extremely_Powerful_Capybaras/) in Unity.

## About
At Studio Bravarda, we incorporated [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) into our first game, [Sky Caravan](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1792270/Sky_Caravan/). Since the ImGui library is written in C++, we utilized the [uImGui](https://github.com/psydack/uimgui) wrapper to integrate it with Unity. This significantly accelerated our iteration, debugging, and overall game development processes. However, due to the library being wrapped, it offers limited IntelliSense support, and reviewing example implementations requires reading them in C++ and adapting them to C#.

That's why I am making our ImGui development console for "Extremely Powerful Capybaras" freely available as an example implementation of Imgui in C#. This console demonstrates multiple use cases for ImGui and illustrates how a complex, shipped game can benefit from it.

Important: This is not a plug-and-play example. I am providing the code here as-is, without any refinements, exactly as it was in the shipped game. This general reference is intended for you to utilize in your games, serving as example implementations and architecture to learn from, adapt, and improve. Over our two years of development, we made numerous decisionsâ€”some successful from day one, and others that proved less effective over time, so this is also not a perfect implementation of ImGui.

## Examples
This session is WIP, I'll put some detailed explanations of some parts of the code as soon as possible.
